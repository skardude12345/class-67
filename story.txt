Once upon a time, there was a hare and a tortoise, and they lived in the same jungle. The hare was very proud and 
one day when he saw the tortoise walking very slowly, he said "Ha! Look how slowly you're walking!" The tortoise 
was upset. "Why don't we have a race then?" He said. 

One fine day, they decided to have a race, and all the animals in the jungle gathered. 


The race started. The rabbit zoomed past the turtle with ease. 
He saw that the tortoise was far behind him, moving very slowly. "Why don't I take a rest?" He said. "He has a lot more 
to go!" So he sat by a tree, and went off to sleep.
